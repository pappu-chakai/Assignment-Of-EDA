        "Potential areas for improvement and optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Robust Error Handling:\n",
        "    - The code uses try-except blocks, which is good. However, instead of generic except blocks,\n",
        "     catch specific exceptions where possible. This will help in debugging and identifying the\n",
        "      root cause of errors more accurately.  For example, instead of `except Exception as e:`,\n",
        "      consider more specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Data Validation:\n",
        "    - Before performing calculations or visualizations, validate the data. Check for missing values,\n",
        "      invalid data types, and outliers.  Handle missing data appropriately (imputation, removal) and\n",
        "      consider outlier treatment (winsorization, removal, transformation).\n",
        "    - Example: `df.isnull().sum()` to check for missing values, and then use imputation or removal\n",
        "               techniques: `df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)` (imputation)\n",

        "\n",
        " 3. Data Cleaning:\n",
        "    - Ensure consistent formatting of columns like 'Engine_Size', 'Annual_Income', 'Date', etc.\n",
        "      Inconsistent data can lead to inaccurate analysis.  For example, convert strings to\n",
        "      numerical values if needed, or parse dates correctly.\n",
        "    - Convert 'Date' to datetime objects earlier in the script so that you don't have to repeat the\n",
        "      conversion in each function that deals with the dates.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. More Informative Visualizations:\n",
        "    - While the code uses several visualizations, enhancing them can improve clarity.\n",
        "    - Add more context to the plots using labels, titles, and legends. Customize the axis ranges for better visibility.\n",
        "    - Consider using alternative visualizations where appropriate. For example, scatter plots with regression lines\n",
        "      for showing relationships between variables.\n",

        " 5. Statistical Significance:\n",
        "   - For certain analyses, consider hypothesis testing to assess the statistical significance of\n",
        "     the observed differences or correlations. For example, when comparing average car prices\n",
        "     across groups, perform t-tests or ANOVA to see if the differences are statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Feature Engineering:\n",
        "    - Create new features that might be more informative.  For example, calculate the age of the car\n",
        "      based on its manufacturing date and the sale date.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. Modularization:\n",
        "    - Organize the code into reusable functions to avoid repetition and improve readability.  For\n",
        "       example, create a function for data loading and cleaning, another function for plotting\n",
        "       specific visualizations, etc.\n",

        "    - Add comments explaining more complex logic, and ensure variables have meaningful names.\n",
